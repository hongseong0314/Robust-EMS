# Robust Energy Management System

ðŸ’¡ energy management systems(EMS) is becoming more complex as fossil fuel-based energy production decreases and renewable energy increases. Especially for net-zero energy communities and isolated microgrids, which receive a limited amount of energy from the external grid, the EMS uncertainty is even greater.

 To address the uncertainties and avoid such failures, robust energy management methods have been proposed based on model-based and model-free approaches

## Cumulative Failure
- Train = 2017-01-01 ~ 2017-01-30
- Test = 2017-01-31 ~ 2017-04-30

## Test Period EMS Status
